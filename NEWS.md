# rig 0.3.1 (not released yet)

## NEW NAME

`rim` is now known as `rig`.

# rim 0.3.0

* New `rim rstudio` command to open a project in RStudio with the specified
  R version.

* `rim add` now performs additonal tasks, to give you an R installation that
  is ready to use:

  - It installs pak for the newly added R version, it is wasn't
    installed before. You can opt out of this with the `--without-pak` option.
    You can select the pak version to install with `--pak-version`.

  - Sets the default R version after installation to the newly
    installed version, if no default is set.

  - Sets the default CRAN mirror to the cloud mirror in the
    system profile, after installation (#11).

  - Sets up RStudio Package Manager (RSPM) as the default repository, if
    your system is supported. See
    https://packagemanager.rstudio.com for more about RSPM. The systems that
    are supported by both RSPM and rim are Windows, and Ubuntu Linux
    18.04, 20.04 and 22.04, all of them on x86_64 architectures only (#15).

* `rim add` now only caches downloaded files for a day.

* `rim system add-pak` now has a new option `--pak-version` to specify the
  pak version to install (stable, rc or devel). Its `--devel` option is
  now deprecated.

* `rim list` now marks the default R version (if any) with `(default)` (#38).

## Windows

* rim has a Chocolatey package now, so on Windows you can install it with
  `choco install rim` and upgrade it with `choco upgrade rim`.

* On Windows `rim default <version>` now sets the default R version in the
  Windows Registry as well, which changes the default for RStudio.
  (Make sure you set the R version in RStudio to the machine's default
  version in Tools -> Global Options -> Basic -> General -> R version.)

## macOS

* On macOS `rim system fix-permissions` now sets the permissions and group
  of the `Current` link. Also, `rim add` now calls `rim system fix-permissions`
  for all installed R versions, because the R installed changes the
  permissions of all of them.

# rim 0.2.3

* `rim system allow-debugger` and `rim system allow-core-dumps` now work on
  macOS Big Sur.

# rim 0.2.2

* rim now supports the next version of R:
  ```
  rim resolve next
  rim add next
  ```
  The next version of R is R-alpha, R-beta, R-rc or R-prerelease if there
  is an active R release process, and it is R-patched otherwise.

# rim 0.2.1

## Linux

* rim now supports arm64 Linux, currently the following distributions:
  Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 & 22.04 and Debian 9, 10 & 11.

* rim now supports Debian 11, on arm64 and x86_64.

## macOS

* New macOS `rim system` commands to allow debugging:
  `rim system allow-debugger`; and to allow core dumps:

* rim now uses better R-devel URLs on macOS, that do not fail if the daily
  build failed on mac.r-project.org.

* Fix resolution of older Windows installers, they were moved to
  another URL.

# rim 0.2.0

* New Linux version.

* On macOS rim now asks for your password for tasks that require admin
  access.

  registry entries
